# Refactoring: A First Example - sample code


This repo follows the example from Chapter 1 of the book [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) by Martin Fowler.

## About this project

The code is written in javascript intended to be run on nodejs.

The repo contains the code from the book plus a small main file and test file in order to execute the code.

You can run the tests with `node test.js`.

The repo has two branches:

- `main` - which starts with the code the book starts with allowing you to code along-side the book.
- `refactored` - which contains all the changes made in the book in commit named with the refactoring technique used
